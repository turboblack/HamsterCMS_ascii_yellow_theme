![this is what theme looks like](https://github.com/turboblack/HamsterCMS_ascii_yellow_theme/blob/main/ascii_yellow.png)

To use a template, create an **ascii_yellow** folder in the **templates** folder, paste theme file there, open the admin panel on the hosting, select the page, and specify this template in the options.

I invite you to visit the hosting that runs on this CMS
